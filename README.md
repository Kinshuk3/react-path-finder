# Pathfinding Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `Purpose`

This project helps the user easily visualize and understand the shortest path using the A* graph Algorithm.
It goes from "Red" (start node) to "Green" (end node) to find the path if there exists any, by avoiding randomly located black obstacles that change every time the page is refreshed.

### `Running`

Click "Visualize path" below the grid.
